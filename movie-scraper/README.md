# Movie Scraper

The **movie scraper** process our dataset and build a populated database schema with all movies.

Here we use the [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library. This library reads our [dataset CSV file](./resources/dataset/IMDB-Movie-Data.csv) and, given the _MAX_MOVIES_, we add the movies to **movies** service.
